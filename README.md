This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Cloudflare R2

Product and category images are uploaded to R2 through its S3-compatible API.
Configure these server-side variables before creating catalog records with images:

```bash
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
R2_BUCKET=
R2_PUBLIC_URL=https://media.example.com
```

`R2_PUBLIC_URL` must be the public bucket URL or a custom domain connected to
the bucket. Because media files upload directly from the browser through a
short-lived presigned URL, configure this CORS policy on the R2 bucket (replace
the origin with the admin application's origin):

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": ["https://example.com"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["PUT"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["Content-Type", "Cache-Control"],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
]
```

Apply the Prisma migrations before starting the application:

```bash
bunx --bun prisma migrate deploy
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
